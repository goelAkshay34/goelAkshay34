## Summary

Machine Learning Engineer with 5.5+ years of hands-on experience, specialized in building end-to-end Generative AI and Machine Learning solutions. I possess extensive expertise in Python and a strong background in building and deploying AI applications using libraries like Langchain/ LangGraph for NLP tasks, TensorFlow/PyTorch for deep learning, scikit-learn for Machine Learning, CI/CD pipelines and GCP - Vertex AI Platform & AWS services for cloud infrastructure. 

Proven ability to design microservices and deploy user-focused AI solutions, leveraging client-server based architecture. Hands-on experience in developing Agentic AI projects, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Multimodal Prompt Engineering and fine-tuning LLMs. Passionate about the latest AI advancements and eager to collaborate on innovative projects that deliver tangible value

Currently, I am building AI Data Vizualization with Agentic AI using LangGraph.
